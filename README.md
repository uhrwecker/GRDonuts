# GRDonuts
Toolkit for creating plots and computing stable equipotential surfaces of fluids orbiting a compact stellar object (see Zarotti: Relativistic Hydrodynamics)

## Theoretical background

For perfect fluids, orbiting a compact, spherical, staionary object, the Potential W (in terms of the metric) of the fluid is given by:

$$W = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt -(g_{tt} + 2l g_{t \phi} + l^2 g_{\phi \phi} )$$
